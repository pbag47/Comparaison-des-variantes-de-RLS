## Operating mode

The main executable file is `main.m`. 
This file contains the configurable settings and calls several functions by following the procedure in the table below. 

| File                                                                        | Description |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `main.m`                                                                    | First, the program makes a list of every simulation request (each noise type, each algorithm, each variable), according to the parameters set by the user. |
| `+Functions\Parse_existing_results.m`                                       | Then, the previous simulation results are inspected to make sure that the exact same simulation is not ran twice. If a requested simulation already exists in the previous results file, this simulation request is automatically discarded. |
| `+Functions\Algorithm_test.m`                                               | Then, a testing procedure starts: <br> For each requested noise type, the program counts the requested algorithms <br> <ul> For each algorithm, the program searches for all the possible combinations of requested values for its tuning parameters <br> <ul> For each combination of values, the selected algorithm is executed with an input signal that corresponds to the selected noise type, and a constant desired impulse response. </ul> </ul> |
| `+Functions\detect_convergence.m`                                           | <ul> <ul> Then, the convergence time and the residual error are deduced from the error RMS curve. </ul> </ul> |
| `+Functions\remove_NaN_results.m` <br> `+Functions\save_results.m`          | The results are finally filtered and saved as a _struct_ variable in a file set by the user. |
| `+Functions\compare_algorithmsn.m` <br> `+Functions\performance_overview.m` | Once this testing procedure is finished, the results are displayed as graph figures and tables. |

### Requesting algorithm tests

In `main.m`, the variable that contains requested simulation settings is called `Parameters`.
This variable is a structure organized as described by the following example picture:
![Structure of Parameters variable](https://github.com/pbag47/Comparaison-des-variantes-de-RLS/blob/Generalized_TDLMS/Parameters_structure_graph.png)

For this example, the simulation environment is configured to run 6 different simulations, whose settings are summarized in the next table.

| Algorithm | Noise type  | Name of variable 1 | Value of variable 1 | Name of variable 2 | Value of variable 2 |
| --------- | ----------- | -----------------: | :------------------ | -----------------: | :------------------ |
| RLS       | White_noise | lambda             | 0.9                 |        //          |         //          |
| DWTLMS    | White_noise | beta               | 0.1                 | theta              | 0.7                 |
| DWTLMS    | White_noise | beta               | 0.2                 | theta              | 0.7                 |
| DWTLMS    | Pink_noise  | beta               | 0.4                 | theta              | 0.5                 |
| DWTLMS    | Pink_noise  | beta               | 0.4                 | theta              | 0.8                 |
| DCTLMS    | UAV_noise   | beta               | 0.6                 | theta              | 0.9                 |

In terms of Matlab code, this simulation request is implemented in `main.m` as follows:
```matlab
Parameters.RLS.White_noise.lambda = 0.9 ;

Parameters.DWTLMS.White_noise.beta = [0.1, 0.2] ;
Parameters.DWTLMS.White_noise.theta = 0.7 ;

Parameters.DWTLMS.Pink_noise.beta = 0.4 ;
Parameters.DWTLMS.Pink_noise.theta = [0.5, 0.8] ;

Parameters.DCTLMS.UAV_noise.beta = 0.6 ;
Parameters.DCTLMS.UAV_noise.theta = 0.9 ;
```

If the results are stored in a file and gradually added, the noise types, algorithms and variable names have to remain consistent with the already existing results.

The `Parameters` structure can remain empty. In this case, no simulation is run but the results found in the file provided by `data_file` are displayed.

## Adding new reference signals

The signals used as a reference to test the algorithms are stored in the file `Noise_samples.mat`.
To append a new usable signal, supposedly called 'Signal_name' and stored as the variable `s` in Matlab Workspace, run the following code in the Command Window:

```Matlab
load('Noise_samples.mat')
Noise_samples.Signal_name = s ;
save('Noise_samples.mat', "Noise_samples')
```

To verify that the new signal has successfully been imported, run the file `plot_input_signals.m` and make sure that it is correctly displayed and named in the resulting figure.

Then, this new signal can be called from the `main.m` as a reference signal to test algorithms, see Part "Requesting algorithm tests".
