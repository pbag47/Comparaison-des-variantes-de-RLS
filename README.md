# Project: Comparaison des variantes de RLS

This project is a simulation environment made to benchmark different Least Squares algorithms in terms of convergence time and residual error, for various input signals.

It is supported on Matlab version R2023b or later.

## Operating mode

The main executable file is `main.m`. 
This file contains the configurable settings and calls several functions by following the procedure in the table below. 

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `main.m` | First, the program makes a list of every simulation request (each noise type, each algorithm, each variable), according to the parameters set by the user. |
| `+Functions\Parse_existing_results.m` | Then, the previous simulation results are inspected to make sure that the exact same simulation is not ran twice. If a requested simulation already exists in the previous results file, this simulation request is automatically discarded. |
| `+Functions\Algorithm_test.m` | Then, a testing procedure starts: <br> For each requested noise type, the program counts the requested algorithms <br> <ul> For each algorithm, the program searches for all the possible combinations of requested values for its tuning parameters <br> <ul> For each combination of values, the selected algorithm is executed with an input signal that corresponds to the selected noise type, and a constant desired impulse response. </ul> </ul> |
| `+Functions\detect_convergence.m` | <ul> <ul> Then, the convergence time and the residual error are deduced from the error RMS curve. </ul> </ul> |
| `+Functions\remove_NaN_results.m` <br> `+Functions\save_results.m` | The results are finally filtered and saved as a _struct_ variable in a file set by the user. |
| `+Functions\plot_performance_comparison.m` <br> `+Functions\plot_individual_results.m` | Once this testing procedure is finished, the results are displayed as graph figures. |

## Settings

| Variable | Type hint: Default value | Description | Additionnal information |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `filter_length` | int: 32 | Number of taps that define the impulse response of the adaptive FIR filter | Must be an integer power of 2 |
| `data_file` | str: '+Results/test.mat' | File in which the simulation results are stored (automatically created if the file does not exist) | Must terminate by '.mat' <br> By default, all results files are stored in the __+Results__ package sub-folder |
| `save_figures` | bool: true | Automatically save the figures generated by `+Functions\plot_performance_comparison.m` and `+Functions\plot_individual_results.m` as .fig and .pdf files |  |
| `plot_all_error_curves` | bool: false | Display the error curve obtained after each simulation | Only for debug purposes |
| `noise_types` | cell: {'White_noise'} | Select which input noise to use as a reference signal for the algorithms | Choose one or more elements from the following list: <br> - 'White_noise' <br> - 'Pink_noise' <br> - 'Brownian_noise' <br> - 'Tonal_input' <br> - 'UAV_noise' |

### Requesting the test of a specific algorithm

In `main.m`, the variable that contains requested simulation settings is called `Parameters`.
This variable is a structure organized as follows:
